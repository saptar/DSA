## Hash Table

Hash table is a DS which stores data in an associative manner.  
Data is stored in an array format where each data value has its own unique index value .  
Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.  

### Hashing

Hashing is a technique to convert range of key values to range of indexes.


### Linear probing.

It may so happen that running hashing function on a keys may return the same value.  
In such cases, we look ahead to find the next empty location to store the new value.  

### Basic operations

- Search : search an element in hash table  
- Insert : insert an element in hash table  
- Delete : delete an element from hash table
