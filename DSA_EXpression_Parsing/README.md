### Examples of arithmetic notations

|S.n. |	Infix Notation | Prefix Notation | Postfix Notation |
|--- | --- | --- | --- |
|1 | a + b | + a b | a b + |
|2 | (a + b) * c | * + a b c | a b + c * |
|3 | a * (b + c) | * a + b c | a b c + * |
|4 | a / b + c / d | + / a b / c d | a b / c d / + |
|5 | (a + b) * (c + d) | * + a b + c d | a b + c d + * |
|6 | ((a + b) * c) - d | - * + a b c d | a b + c * d - |
