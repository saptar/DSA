# Queue data structure

Queue like stack is also an abstract data structure.  
However , unlike stack, a queue DS is opened at both end.  
One end is used to insert data (enqueue) and the other end is used to extract data.  
Queue follows FIFO methodology.

### Basic operations on queue.

- enqueue() - insert data into the queue
- dequeue() - remove(access) an item from the queue.

Few more functions are required to make the above functions efficient and they are :  

- peek() - get the element at the front of the queue without actually removing it.
- isFull() - checks if the queue is full.
- isEmpty() - checks if the queue is empty.
